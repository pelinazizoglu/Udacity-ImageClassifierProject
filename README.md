# AI Programming with Python - Udacity
# Image Classifier Project

• Challenge: Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree project titled as 'Image Classifier' attempts to train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice we had to train this classifier, then export it for use in our application. We had used a dataset (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories. 

• Result: Using the following software and Python libraries: Torch, PIL, Matplotlib.pyplot, Numpy, Seaborn, Torchvision. Thus, achieved an accuracy of 80% on test dataset as a result of above approaches. Plotted the probabilities for the top 5 classes as a bar graph, along with the input image.

• Software and Libraries: This project uses the following software and Python libraries:
NumPy, pandas, Sklearn / scikit-learn, Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)

• Code File: Open file jupyter notebook imageclassifierproject.ipynb
